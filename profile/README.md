[This project will create the world's largest Greenhouse Gas Emissions dataset that will empower anyone to join in the work on climate and provide informed data for climate action.](https://ribbitnetwork.org/)

Ribbit Network is a large network of open-source, Greenhouse Gas (CO2 and hopefully other gasses in the future) Detection Sensors. 
 
## [Frog Sensors](https://github.com/Ribbit-Network/ribbit-network-frog-sensor)

Our “Frogs” are tiny sensors that you can 
[build](https://github.com/Ribbit-Network/ribbit-network-frog-sensor/tree/main/hardware) 
or [buy](https://ribbitnetwork.org/) and deploy at your own home! It’s a small, 
open-source box that measures the amount of CO2 in the air using a tiny laser.
It's easy to set up and will constantly record valuable scientific data on our climate.
Frogs are one of the species that are most affected by climate change! 
Just like our sensors, they ribbit to one another to create a powerful network 
of data about the environment.

## [Dashboard](https://github.com/Ribbit-Network/ribbit-network-dashboard)
The Ribbit Network saves the sensor data and makes it accessible for scientists everywhere to analyze and pinpoint emissions. Using this data we can identify and track emissions, allowing us to verify our assumptions about climate and hold ourselves accountable through corporate, government, and individual action.

## Questions?
[Check out the Frequently Asked Questions section.](https://github.com/Ribbit-Network/ribbit-network-faq) If you don't see your question, let us know either in a Github Discussion or via Discord.

## Background Information
[See the Wiki for background research.](https://github.com/Ribbit-Network/ribbit-network-sensor/wiki/Background-Research) This project is inspired by some awesome research by incedible scientists in academia.

## Support
Ribbit Network is a non-profit (501c3) creating the world's largest Greenhouse Gas Emissions dataset that will empower anyone to join in the work on climate and provide informed data for climate action. We're an all volunteer team building everything we do in the open-source community.

If you would like to consider sponsoring Ribbit Nework you can do [via this link](https://givebutter.com/ribbitnetwork). The money is used to pay for software fees, purchase R&D hardware and generally support the mission of Ribbit Network.
